	<h3> About </h3>
	<p> The Environmental Protection Agency is a federal agency founded in the United States dedicated to protecting human health and the environment around them. The EPA is instrumental in implementing key environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and others. The agency's mission is to ensure that all Americans have clean air, water, and land and to protect future generations from significant environmental risks.</p>
	<h3> Key Responsibilities  </h3>
	<p> Policies: The EPA develops and enforces regulations to address various environmental issues, such as air and water quality, hazardous waste management, chemical safety, etc... It sets standards and guidelines that industries, businesses, and individuals must adhere to in order to minimize environmental impact. </p>

	<p> Research and Monitoring: The EPA uses scientific research and monitoring programs to assess the state of the environment, identifying ireggularities and emerging threats. This information shapes the policies they create. </p>
	<p>
	Environmental Cleanup: The EPA is involved in the cleanup of contaminated sites, including Superfund sitesâ€”locations heavily polluted with hazardous substances. The agency works to ensure the responsible parties address environmental damage and restore affected areas.
	</p>

	<p> Education: The EPA plays a role in educating the public about environmental issues, promoting awareness, and providing information on how individuals and communities can contribute to environmental protection. </p>

	<p> Working with States and Tribes: The EPA often collaborates with state environmental agencies and tribal governments to implement and enforce regulations at the local level. This partnership helps address regional and community-specific environmental concerns. </p>

	<p> Foreign Efforts: The EPA engages in international efforts to address global environmental challenges. It collaborates with other countries and organizations to address issues such as climate change, ozone depletion, and cross-border pollution.</p>
