	<h3> Solar Energy </h3>
	<p> How it works:
	Solar radiation can be converted into thermal energy or electrical energy and is commonly used for heating houses and water heaters. Sun shines onto solar panel, energy absorbed into PV cells in panel, energy creates electrical charges that move in response to internal electrical field within cell which causes electricity to flow
	</p>
	<p>Advantages: Lots of potential- since about 200,000 times the worldâ€™s total daily electric-generating capacity is received by Earth every day in the form of solar 
	Wind energy. </p>
	<h3> Wind Energy </h3>
	<p> How it works:
	Wind energy is generated by harnessing the kinetic energy of moving air with wind turbines. As the wind turns the blades, a generator converts this rotational motion into electricity, which is then transmitted for distribution.
	</p>
	<p>Advantages: Wind energy is abundant and environmentally friendly, producing no emissions during operation. It is a renewable resource with vast potential, contributing significantly to global energy needs and reducing reliance on traditional, polluting energy sources.</p>
	<h3> Hydro Energy </h3>
	<p> How it works: Hydro energy is produced by capturing the kinetic energy of flowing water. In a hydroelectric power plant, the force of moving water turns turbines connected to generators. As the turbines spin, they convert the water's kinetic energy into electricity, which is then transmitted for distribution.
	</p>
	<p>Advantages: Hydro energy is a clean and renewable power source. It produces electricity without emitting pollutants and contributes to reducing reliance on fossil fuels. With a consistent flow of water, hydro energy provides a reliable and sustainable solution for generating electricity.</p>
	<h3> Geothermal Energy </h3>
	<p> How it works: Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's internal heat for power generation. In geothermal power plants, heat from the Earth's interior is accessed through wells, and the steam or hot water produced is used to turn turbines connected to generators. This rotational motion is then converted into electricity, which is transmitted for distribution.
	</p>
	<p>Advantages: Geothermal energy is a clean and sustainable source of power, emitting minimal greenhouse gases. It provides a continuous and reliable energy supply, unaffected by weather conditions. Additionally, geothermal power plants have a relatively small physical footprint, making them environmentally friendly in terms of land use..</p>
	<h3> Biomass Energy </h3>
	<p> How it works: Biomass energy harnesses the organic matter derived from plants and animals for power generation. In biomass power plants, organic materials like wood, agricultural crops, or waste are burned or converted into biofuels. The heat produced is used to generate steam, which, in turn, drives turbines connected to generators, producing electricity.
	</p>
	<p>Advantages: Biomass energy is considered renewable as long as organic resources are managed sustainably. It aids in waste reduction by utilizing agricultural residues and organic waste for energy production. Biomass can serve as a carbon-neutral energy source, as the carbon dioxide emitted during combustion is part of the natural carbon cycle. It also contributes to local economies by promoting the use of locally sourced organic materials.</p>
